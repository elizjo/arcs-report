## make decision on Airsim v. UnrealCV
| UnrealCV | Airsim |
|:---------|:--------|
|+ less config = easier to use | + more settings = harder to use/ implement more custom features|
|+ Lab has past experience using UnrealCV on UE 4.27 |+ 13.2k stars (more contributors on github)|
|- no support for UE5 (installation unknown) | - no support for UE5 (errors during installing on virtual enviroment) |
+ we would like to generate a image dataset custom to our built enviroment (Edmunds & Estella Buildings @ Pomona College)
+ don't need elaborate features, just camera in simulated enviroment and use python script to move camera to capture images 
+ past experience doing projects --> try to get a simple working workflow/project working first before trying to use more complex tools

## Installation + Basics of UE5
[Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/ptCN4cysDig)
+ learned shortcuts to navigate 
  + (f- reset view, e- rotate objects, w- tramslate objects, top left changes user view mode, top right concerns camera movement/ objects)
  + most important modes (on left corner, modeling and select)
+ played w/ functionality on pre-built enviroments

## adapting UnrealCV to UE5
read [Architecture of UnrealCV](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/master/reference/architecture.html) to better understand relationship b/t UnrealCV and UE
  + unrealCV has 2 functions: 
  1) unrealCV server embedded in UE
  2) unrealCV client to send commands to control server
  + mentioned that built, trained model can be run on Pomona's server and used on UE simulated enviroment

+ approaches -> use git+gitlink 

# Issues
+ needed to select Linix (not Windows) on ssh setup on vscode since server runs on Linix
+ Python was not configured after Mamba installation 

# Plans
+ configure unrealCV with UE5
+ create virtual enviroments in Unreal Engine from objects created in Reality Capture

Authors noted that "While AirSim is focused on robotics simulation, which requires more customization with UE4 and more complex to get started.
The design principles and goal of UnrealCV and AirSim are different, but there are many components are in common and a collaboration between these two projects will
be beneficial for the community."
