| 6/23 | watched parts [Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Modeling Tutorial - Learn to Model Inside Unreal!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9InU0xbX7l0&t=666s), met w/ Oliver, decided to model hallways
| 6/24 |  packaged Estella Model as UE5 level, installed UnrealCV plugin, looked at indoor lighting options in UE5

#### Packaging Environments in UE5

+ only wanted to package one level, not project 
  + project settings > packaging > List of maps to include in a packaged build > add one array elem

fixing issues
1. "lighting needs to be rebuilt"
    + Build (top menu bar) > Build Lighting Only

2. "SDK Not Setup Error in Unreal Engine 5' [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoIdyhjW9e0)
+ installed [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)
+ installed [.Net CORE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-3.1.420-windows-x64-installer)

3. at compiling => "missing the C++ toolchain" [solution](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/)
+ installed Visual Studio Installer 
+ VS Installer > Modify > Workloads > Desktop development w/ C++ > Game development with C++ > Check off Unreal Engine installer
+ VS Installer > Modify > Workloads > Desktop development w/ C++ > Check off C++ profiling tools, C++ Address Sanitizer
+ followed additional steps to configure Visual Studio for UE5

4. Packaging w/ UnrealCV

#### Indoor lighting
[MuddHallway](hallway-lighting.png)
+ created actor w/ 3 spotlights, modified light radius & softness
+ still exploring how to eliminate harsh shadows between light and ceiling
+ used Kenny's Reality Capture Model using Evelyn Hasama's pictures of Mudd Hallway


#### Using Large Reality Capture Scans + UE5 Modeling
Goal: take as accurate photos as possible, limit UE5 Modeling
+ realized this after reading the capabilities of modeling tool in UE5
UE5 does a good job smoothing texture, but hard to fix spatial distortion 

Useful Modeling Tools
+ Deform > Smooth
+ TriModel > HFill (fills holes in mesh!)

Modeling Maze-like spaces
+ learn how to light indoor spaces (use rec lights)

# Plans
+ Explore NVIDIA NeRFs if subpar results from modeling this week [NeRFs: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRlN-cYFxTk)
