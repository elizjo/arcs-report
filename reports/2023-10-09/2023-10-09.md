![wandb](wandb.png)
+ pkl model in training pipeline
+ use fastai's model = load_learner(pkl-file)
+ TODO: modify inference to classify individual images (versus in UE)

# Real Life Images
![real life image](real-life-example1.png)
+ above is an easy to classify image (obvious that forward is correct direction)

![ambig image](ambig.png)
+  without angle threshold to classify image direction => very ambiguous on what label should be
