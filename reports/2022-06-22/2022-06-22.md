| 6/18-19, 6/21 | took more reference photos & measurements, finished layout of Estella
| 6/22 |  imported Kenny's Reality Capture Model of Estella Tables, set up github on lab computer,
researched Unreal Engine's Modeling Tool 
read documentation of exporting binaries/ working with unreal CV

#### Finishing Hand-Build Model of Estella
![Estella-version2](reports\2022-06-22\estella-version2.png)
Helpful tips
+ press on landscape spline point + move tool + alt => lengthens path w/ new point
+ modeling mode = easy to prototype geometric objects w/ proper scale
+ move tool (e) + alt = quick copy of object
+ if landscape spline gets twisted, adjust control points

#### Working w/ Reality Capture
+ looked at former student's work on photogrammetry
+ reviewed [RealityCapture to UE5 - Workflow Tutorial](https://youtu.be/WrCOhes1Zgg?t=2216) 
+ researched on how to improve texture & smoothness of mesh
+ helpful sources:
  + [Enable UDIM in Unreal in Two Minutes! (4.26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-eG2TDU048)
  + for smoothing imported meshes [Unreal Engine 5â€™s modeling mode takes shape](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-blog/unreal-engine-5-s-modeling-mode-takes-shape)

#### Modeling Tool 
[How to sculpt meshes directly in Unreal Engine (working Boolean and sculpting tool ue4)](https://youtu.be/aBPQsfz-qwY)

# Issues
+ Manually building models is fun, but time intensive
+ Unreal Engine crashes frequently using the Modeling or Foilage Mode
+ wondering if intense use of textures on Estella Model will cause problems in packaging and sharing 
+ "above texture streaming limit" = running UE5 too long, just reboot
+ forgot hotkey shortcuts on Unreal Engine ([Editor](https://defkey.com/unreal-engine-5-shortcuts?orientation=landscape&filter=false&cellAlternateColor=%23d6ffef&showPageNumber=true&showPageNumber=false&pdf=True)) ([Blueprint](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/blog/BlueprintCheatSheet-1989117414.pdf))

# Plans
+ continue evaluating whether to scan whole courtyard or just singular components (tables, chairs, metal assets)
+ learn how to remove uv/shadow information of assets
+ learn from Kenny about taking pictures for Reality Capture
+ learn more about creating accurate textures of imported 3D assets
+ package level & send to ARCS server (be able to send built enviroment, allow agent to move though landscape, take practice pics)
