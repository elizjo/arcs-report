# Agenda
6/9 | watched until 1:56 on tutorial, skipping baked lighting @ 1:56 (Archviz Lighting Baked = alternative to lumen, higher quality but not dynamic)

6/10 | finished tutorial + build estella model 1, skipping gameplay @ 2:50 (come back to it during break maybe?)

6/17 | use LiDAR + [Polycam](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/polycam-lidar-3d-scanner/id1532482376) on iPhone, import obj into Unreal, build box same dimension as measurements, compare results 


# Activities
#### Experimenting w/ Polycam 
+ Polycam = iPhone app (needs iPhone 12 pro for LiDAR)
+ super efficient (~ 1-2 min for scan + > 1 min to process small objects)
+ to accurate scale 
+ subpar performance to Reality Capture, also not great on reflective surfaces or outdoors
+ needs enough lighting, doesn't work well in dimly lit, cluttered spaces
+ needs photography skill/knowledge to avoid incorrect shape

#### Trial 1 - 6/10


#### Manual Build of Estella Courtyard

+ took 4ever -> conclusion: rely more on reality capture
+ since no reality capture, took reference photos, hand-measured Estella walkways, used google earth for 2D view from above to estimate scale

#### Possible Approaches to Build Outdoor Spaces @ Pomona
+ find plants, grass, rocks on Quixel Bridge
+ reality capture, how much/ scope of useage? -> try to rely on reality capture as much as possible, use editor to adjust shape

1. try manual model in Unreal Engine
   + Problem: very time consuming
  [landscape splines](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/landscape-splines-in-unreal-engine/) to create mesh of road + pavement spaces
   + [working with landscape layers](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/landscape-edit-layers-in-unreal-engine/)
   + material (see "Adding a Static Mesh Actor to a spline")
   + width (landscape spline > half-width)
   + depth (landscape spline meshes > scale > z axis)
   + move whole spline > control points
   +  problem: don't know how to realign when crooked -> landscape spline > reset rotation to default on

    + use of shape mesh to use material instances

2. Use reality capture
   + Problem: windows/ reflective surfaces -> more difficult to capture accurate model (Estella Courtyard has many windows/ metal objects)
   + LiDAR for indoor spaces, drone/ camera for outdoor spaces
   + worried that material instances were difficult to work with 3D assets -> solved by [UDIMs in Unreal Engine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-eG2TDU048)

## Notes- Continuing UE5 Tutorial
[Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gQmiqmxJMtA)
#### goals from week of 6/8:
+ figure out to control color, metallic, roughness qualities of materials through python script (independent of UE5 interface)  
   + leads: StaticSwitchParameter in Blueprint -> control nodes concerning normal maps
   + additional material inst. variables = albedo controls (contrast var) + specular > specular from albedo override
#### shapes
+ static mesh = fbx/ obj (silouette of object)
+ place texture on top
  + sRGB on color texture, off for normal & roughness textures
  + occulsion mask combines metallic (R- channel) roughness (G-channel) normal (B-channel)

#### lighting
+ soften lighting -> source radius
+ indirect lighting intensity -> how much light bounces off objects
+ spot light -> inner cone angle, outer cone angle
Outdoor Lighting
+ directional light = sunlight, skylight needs directional light to work (bc captures dir light)
  + directional light -> set to moveable & atmosphere sun light is checked -> drag in sky atmosphere -> skylight + set to moveable & real time capture

Indoor lighting
+ directional, skylight, sky atmosphere, post processing volume (Infinite Extent (unbound) -> apply to whole world)

#### Landscape
+ left/right bracket key -> decrease/increase brush size
+ shift + 1 -> select mode, shift + 2 -> landscape, shift + 3 -> foilage
+ Landmass Plugin to scupt landscape OR Gaia or World Machine to Sculpt Landscape
+ control + b -> locate asset in content browser

3D Plants
+ Material instance > details > EnableGrassWind (check off both boxes) 
+ painting settings, paint density & Painting > Density / 1Kau
   + varying plant sizes + types, select multiple foilage & Painting > Scale X (specify max/min)
   + erase = shift
   + move plants (Foliage > select), not select mode
   + avoid painting on static meshes, uncheck static meshes in Foliage > Paint > Filters

#### Nanite- for static meshes
enable Nanite
1. select static mesh (ctrl + b) > right click > nanite
2. select nanite on download on quixel bridge
see Nanite > lit > Nanite Visualization > triangles

#### Building a Landscape
content > fix up redirectors in folder (if move tons of content folders -> ensures no assets left behind)

# Issues
+ lots of documentation, allows for many customizations but v. confusing
+ tree assets very limited, can't find matches for some plants
+ landscape splines are very tricky to work with, realized that 3D shape mesh needs to be placed before material instance
+ scaling (took measurements of walkways at Estella courtyard, but had to do inch -> cm conversion)

# Plans
+ try LiDAR on iPhone 13 Pro to scan indoor spaces
+ build ARCS room in Unreal Engine by measuring dimensions, creating walls to scaled size
+ work with Keneth to use Reality Capture to implement custom 3D assets in Unreal Engine
