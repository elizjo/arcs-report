# Agenda
6/9 -> watch until 1:56 on tutorial, skipping baked lighting @ 1:56 (Archviz Lighting Baked = alternative to lumen, higher quality but not dynamic)
6/10 -> finish tutorial + build creek landscape, skipping gameplay @ 2:50 (come back to it during break maybe?)
skipped setting up creek landscape (3:17)
6/17 -> 

# Activities

#### Trial 1 - 6/10
![estella-version1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78676977/173169267-903a1cc4-2b95-4298-86c0-4ba1ca0a412b.png)
took 4ever but was fun :)
#### Possible Approaches to Build Outdoor Spaces @ Pomona
+ find plants, grass, rocks on Quixel Bridge
+ google earth, 2D view from above to estimate scale

1. use [landscape splines](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/landscape-splines-in-unreal-engine/) to create mesh of road + pavement spaces
   + [working with landscape layers](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/landscape-edit-layers-in-unreal-engine/)
   + material (see "Adding a Static Mesh Actor to a spline")
   + width (landscape spline > half-width)
   + depth (landscape spline meshes > scale > z axis)
   + move whole spline > control points
   +  problem: don't know how to realign when crooked -> landscape spline > reset rotation to default on

    + use of spline meshes to use material instances

2. Use reality capture for benches, special objects, or scaling?

## Notes- Continuing UE5 Tutorial
[Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gQmiqmxJMtA)
#### goals from week of 6/8:
+ figure out to control color, metallic, roughness qualities of materials through python script (independent of UE5 interface)  
   + leads: StaticSwitchParameter in Blueprint -> control nodes concerning normal maps
   + additional material inst. variables = albedo controls (contrast var) + specular > specular from albedo override
#### shapes
+ static mesh = fbx/ obj (silouette of object)
+ place texture on top
  + sRGB on color texture, off for normal & roughness textures
  + occulsion mask combines metallic (R- channel) roughness (G-channel) normal (B-channel)

#### lighting
+ soften lighting -> source radius
+ indirect lighting intensity -> how much light bounces off objects
+ spot light -> inner cone angle, outer cone angle
Outdoor Lighting
+ directional light = sunlight, skylight needs directional light to work (bc captures dir light)
  + directional light -> set to moveable & atmosphere sun light is checked -> drag in sky atmosphere -> skylight + set to moveable & real time capture

Indoor lighting
+ directional, skylight, sky atmosphere, post processing volume (Infinite Extent (unbound) -> apply to whole world)

#### Landscape
+ left/right bracket key -> decrease/increase brush size
+ shift + 1 -> select mode, shift + 2 -> landscape, shift + 3 -> foilage
+ Landmass Plugin to scupt landscape OR Gaia or World Machine to Sculpt Landscape
+ control + b -> locate asset in content browser

3D Plants
+ Material instance > details > EnableGrassWind (check off both boxes) 
+ painting settings, paint density & Painting > Density / 1Kau
   + varying plant sizes + types, select multiple foilage & Painting > Scale X (specify max/min)
   + erase = shift
   + move plants (Foliage > select), not select mode
   + avoid painting on static meshes, uncheck static meshes in Foliage > Paint > Filters

#### Nanite- for static meshes
enable Nanite
1. select static mesh (ctrl + b) > right click > nanite
2. select nanite on download on quixel bridge
see Nanite > lit > Nanite Visualization > triangles

#### Building a Landscape
content > fix up redirectors in folder (if move tons of content folders -> ensures no assets left behind)


# Issues
+ lots of documentation, allows for many customizations but v. confusing
+ tree assets very limited, can't find matches for some plants
+ landscape splines are very tricky to work with 
[Any roadblocks you have encountered or issues that you want to discuss.  Please include as many details as possible.]

# Plans
+ look at lighting options on UE5 (research Lumen?)

# Article Summaries

[(Optional) Summarize any research articles you read in the past week.]
