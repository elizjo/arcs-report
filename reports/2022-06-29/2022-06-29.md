| 6/23 | watched parts [Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Modeling Tutorial - Learn to Model Inside Unreal!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9InU0xbX7l0&t=666s), met w/ Oliver, decided to model hallways
| 6/24 |  packaged Estella Model as UE5 level, installed UnrealCV plugin, looked at indoor lighting options in UE5
| 6/27  | drone pictures w/ Prof Los Huertos, packaged model w/ UnrealCV, learned basics of UnrealCV, scouted hallways on campus
| 6/28 | drone pics, drone manual documentation, UE5 Commands in Game Mode, literature review
| 6/29 | off-campus

#### Packaging Environments in UE5 for Windows

Pre-compile issues
1. "lighting needs to be rebuilt"
    + Build (top menu bar) > Build Lighting Only

2. only wanted to package specific levels, not all in project 
  + project settings > packaging > List of maps to include in a packaged build > add one array elem

3. accidently move items w/ multiple components
+ left click on asset in outliner, select "attach" => will create group of objects

4. created 3rd Person Game, not 1st person
+ create 1st person game, click +Add on top left of content browser > First Person OR manual migrate FirstPerson Folder in Content
+ world settings > Game Mode section > GameMode Override (FirstPersonGameMode)

Packaging Issues
1. "SDK Not Setup Error in Unreal Engine 5' [solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoIdyhjW9e0)
+ installed [Windows SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk/)
+ installed [.Net CORE](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/sdk-3.1.420-windows-x64-installer)

2. at compiling => "missing the C++ toolchain" [solution](https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/DevelopmentSetup/VisualStudioSetup/)
+ installed Visual Studio Installer 
+ VS Installer > Modify > Workloads > Desktop development w/ C++ > Game development with C++ > Check off Unreal Engine installer
+ VS Installer > Modify > Workloads > Desktop development w/ C++ > Check off C++ profiling tools, C++ Address Sanitizer
+ followed additional steps to configure Visual Studio for UE5

3. Packaging w/ UnrealCV 
+ followed Simon's documentation to [install UnrealCV](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JNUTa4mtYO1HfRb6MZphGecvot_VNfFEwurrTE0savI/edit?usp=sharing)

changes from instructions: 
+ Modify UE5 Engine file (Engine\Config\ConsoleVariables.ini) by adding r.ForceDebugViewModes = 1
+ Install UnrealCV to Project 
  + Go to project folder with .uproject file
  + create folder titled Plugins
  + stick UnrealCV folder into Plugins folder

#### Learning UE5 Game Mode & UnrealCV Commands
Game Mode
UE5 Commands [list- outdated](https://www.oldunreal.com/UnrealReference/Console.html)
| function | command |
| :--        |:--   |
| change levels |  open <name of level> OR SwitchLevel <name of level> |
| go back to level spawn point | RestartLevel |
| open command box | ` (button above tab) |
| exit fullscreen | shift + F8 |
| show no texture, only mesh | shift + F4 |
| no gravity | fly OR ghost (walk to reverse) |


UnrealCV Commands [list](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/latest/reference/commands.html)
+ vset /viewmode object_mask 
+ vget /camera/0/depth (captures screenshot)
+ vget /objects (lists objects in view = potentially helpful for modifying texture of objects in view)

[Useage with UE5 Editor](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/latest/plugin/custom_scene.html)
+ doesn't work >:\


#### Indoor lighting
![MuddHallway](hallway-lighting.png)
+ created actor w/ 3 spotlights, modified light radius & softness
+ still exploring how to eliminate harsh shadows between light and ceiling
+ used Kenny's Reality Capture Model using Evelyn Hasama's pictures of Mudd Hallway
+ explore useage with stero camera

#### Using Large Reality Capture Scans + UE5 Modeling
Goal: take as accurate photos as possible, limit UE5 Modeling
+ realized this after reading the capabilities of modeling tool in UE5
UE5 does a good job smoothing texture, but hard to fix spatial distortion 

Useful Modeling Tools
+ Deform > Smooth
+ TriModel > HFill (fills holes in mesh!)

Modeling Maze-like spaces
+ learn how to light indoor spaces (use rec lights)

# Issues
+ see "Packaging Environments in UE5" 
+ don't know how to compile game for Linux
+ Teleporting command in UE5 Game Mode?
	
# Plans
+ Explore Vuze+ camera to [create HDR Enviroments](https://blog.polyhaven.com/how-to-create-high-quality-hdri/)
+ research [HDRI Backdrop Visualization Tool](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/hdri-backdrop-visualization-tool-in-unreal-engine/)
+ use iPhone to take more hallway pics
+ package game binary for Linux

# Article Summaries
[NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis](https://cs.pomona.edu/~ajc/other/Mildenhall%20et%20al%20-%202022%20-%20NeRF%20representing%20scenes%20as%20neural%20radiance%20field.pdf): 
Authors created a deep learning method (via MLP, a feedforward ANN) for producing continuous 5D neural radiance fields. 5D coordinates were collected, with 3 spatial coordinates (x,y,z) and two viewing directions (camera angle & rotation). The MLP network mapped each input (the 5D coordinate) to its emitted color (accounting for the change in lighting due to perspective) and volume density to produce one pixel output. As a simplification, this would be repeated for each pixel per the original image dimensions and with each pixel output being plotted on a 3D matrix, producing a 3D model. Has potential to be fill in gaps with photogrammetry models. Although 3D meshes can be created from the NeRFs and dynamic effects (change of lighting) can be applied, there is too much noise on the new non-NeRF models.
