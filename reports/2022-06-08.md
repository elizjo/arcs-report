# Activities

## Comparing Airsim v. UnrealCV
+ deciding which would be better suited for our needs
 + we would like to generate a image dataset custom to our built enviroment (Edmunds & Estella Buildings @ Pomona College)
 + don't need elaborate features, just camera in simulated enviroment and use python script to move camera to capture images 

| UnrealCV | Airsim |
|:---------|:--------|
|+ less config = easier to use | + more settings = harder to use/ implement more custom features|
|+ Lab has past experience using UnrealCV on UE 4.27 |+ 13.2k stars (more contributors on github)|
|- no support for UE5 (installation unknown) | - no support for UE5 (errors during installing on virtual enviroment) |
 + decision - UnrealCV

## Installation + Basics of UE5
[Unreal Engine 5 Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/gQmiqmxJMtA)
+ learned basics of lighting options, post processing volume to apply different image saturation
+ 10 UE units = 10 cm in real world
+ learned shortcuts of navigating point of view, selecting & manipulating objects

+ shortcuts: add base color = 3 + left click, constant value = 1, multiply m + left click, alt to delete connections 
+ generally, objects have 0 or 1 for roughness/metallic characteristics
+ create mirror-like substance (roughness = 0, metallic = 1)

material instances -> dynamically change characteristics of material -> customize amount of noise from textures, base colors etc. 

floor w/ high normal value (lots of noise)          |  smooth floor (normal = 0)

## adapting UnrealCV to UE5
read [Architecture of UnrealCV](http://docs.unrealcv.org/en/master/reference/architecture.html) to better understand relationship b/t UnrealCV and UE
  + unrealCV has 2 functions: 
  1) unrealCV server embedded in UE
  2) unrealCV client to send commands to control server
  + mentioned that built, trained model can be run on Pomona's server and used on UE simulated enviroment running on local 

+ approaches -> use git+gitlink 


# Issues
+ needed to select Linix (not Windows) on ssh setup on vscode since server runs on Linix
+ Python was not configured after Mamba installation 

# Plans
+ start with modeling ARCS lab room
+ create simulated 3D enviroments in Unreal Engine from objects created in Reality Capture
+ configure unrealCV with UE5

Authors noted that "While AirSim is focused on robotics simulation, which requires more customization with UE4 and more complex to get started.
The design principles and goal of UnrealCV and AirSim are different, but there are many components are in common and a collaboration between these two projects will
be beneficial for the community."
